# preWorkStudyGuide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I am motivated to learn to develop end to end online applications out of frustration from testing on an ERP project. I have a Sass project idea that will increase employee retention, decrease employee frustration, save the project time and money while speeding up the delivery time of tasks all while saving 100's of thousands of dollars which in turn may help the average tax payer. I'm also annoyed with the limited features available on dating apps and am surprised these have not been released. I need to solve these problems.
- I am building this project to take notes, reference as I learn and laugh when I look back.
- The problems this solves are paper waste and it literally helps me learn as I go vy implementing what I learn.
- So far, I've learned that I have a lot to learn but am so excited to begin my journey of creating something from basically nothing.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
